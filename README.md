# About
With Firefox for Android all images on facebook will have a low resolution. 
This problem is known since several years, but there is still no solution for it. 
There are already several threads in the web, 
which disussing this problem (e.g.: [Bugzilla #1232091](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232091)). 


This add-on will override the user-agent string presented to mobile Facebook pages. 
The resolution of alle images will be the same as on Chrome for Android. 

# Installation
This add-on was only tested with Firefox nightly via remote debugging. 
With Firefox 95 it's currently not possible to install your own add-on persistent.
You can only install the recommended add-ons from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

# Fork
This add-on is a fork from the [google-search-fixer](https://github.com/wisniewskit/google-search-fixer). 
It's doing the same for google search. 

# TODO
Submit the add-on to AMO and create a collection with it ([see Mozilla Blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/)).
